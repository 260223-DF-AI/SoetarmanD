-- SETUP:
-- Connect to the server (Azure Data Studio / Database extension/psql)
-- Create a database (I recommend chinook_pg)
-- Execute the Chinook database (from the Chinook_pg.sql file) to create Chinook resources in your server (I recommend doing this from psql)

-- BASIC CHALLENGES
-- List all customers (full name, customer id, and country) who are not in the USA
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as full_name, customer_id, country FROM customer
WHERE country != 'USA';

-- List all customers from Brazil
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as full_name, customer_id, country FROM customer
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

-- List all sales agents
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as full_name, employee_id, title FROM employee
WHERE title like 'Sales%';

-- Retrieve a list of all countries in billing addresses on invoices
SELECT DISTINCT billing_country FROM invoice;   -- only showing distinct values

-- Retrieve how many invoices there were in 2009, and what was the sales total for that year?
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(total) FROM invoice
WHERE invoice_date >= '2009-01-01' AND invoice_date < '2010-01-01'

-- What table has the info I need?
-- What specifically from the table has the data I need?
-- How do we filter out the things I DON'T care about?
-- How do I SELECT/present the data that I have left?

-- (challenge: find the invoice count sales total for every year using one query)
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(total), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM invoice_date) FROM invoice
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM invoice_date);

-- how many line items were there for invoice #37
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoice_line
WHERE invoice_id = 37;

-- how many invoices per country? BillingCountry  # of invoices -
-- Retrieve the total sales per country, ordered by the highest total sales first.
SELECT billing_country, COUNT(billing_country) as num_invoices, SUM(total)
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billing_country
ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC;

-- JOINS CHALLENGES
-- Every Album by Artist
SELECT a.title AS album_name, ar.name AS artist_name 
FROM album a
JOIN artist ar
ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id;

-- (inner keyword is optional for inner join)
-- All songs of the rock genre
SELECT t.name AS song_name, g.name AS genre_name

-- Show all invoices of customers from brazil (mailing address not billing)
SELECT invoice.invoice_id, invoice.customer_id, invoice.invoice_date, invoice.total, customer.country
FROM customer
JOIN invoice ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
WHERE customer.country = 'Brazil';

-- Show all invoices together with the name of the sales agent for each one
SELECT invoice.invoice_date, invoice.total, employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM customer
JOIN invoice ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
JOIN employee ON customer.support_rep_id = employee.employee_id;

-- Which sales agent made the most sales in 2009?
SELECT e.first_name

JOIN employee e ON e.employee_id = c.support_rep_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM i.invoice_date) = 2009
GROUP BY e.employee_id
LIMIT 1;

-- How many customers are assigned to each sales agent?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS customer_count, e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS agent_name
FROM customer c
JOIN employee e ON e.employee_id = c.support_rep_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id;

-- Which track was purchased the most in 2010?
SELECT track.name, SUM(invoice_line.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM track
JOIN invoice_line ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM invoice.invoice_date) = 2010
GROUP BY track.name
ORDER BY SUM(invoice_line.quantity) DESC, track.name ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- Show the top three best selling artists.


-- Which customers have the same initials as at least one other customer?
SELECT concat(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) as full_name, concat(c1.first_name, ' ', c1.last_name) as other_name
FROM customer as c
JOIN customer as c1
ON left(c.first_name, 1) || left(c.last_name, 1) = left(c1.first_name, 1) || left(c1.last_name, 1) 
and c.customer_id <> c1.customer_id;

-- Which countries have the most invoices?


-- Which city has the customer with the highest sales total?


-- Who is the highest spending customer?


-- Return the email and full name of of all customers who listen to Rock.


-- Which artist has written the most Rock songs?


-- Which artist has generated the most revenue?




-- ADVANCED CHALLENGES
-- solve these with a mixture of joins, subqueries, CTE, and set operators.
-- solve at least one of them in two different ways, and see if the execution
-- plan for them is the same, or different.

-- 1. which artists did not make any albums at all?


-- 2. which artists did not record any tracks of the Latin genre?


-- 3. which video track has the longest length? (use media type table)


-- 4. boss employee (the one who reports to nobody)


-- 5. how many audio tracks were bought by German customers, and what was
--    the total price paid for them?


-- 6. list the names and countries of the customers supported by an employee
--    who was hired younger than 35.


-- DML exercises

-- 1. insert two new records into the employee table.


-- 2. insert two new records into the tracks table.


-- 3. update customer Aaron Mitchell's name to Robert Walter


-- 4. delete one of the employees you inserted.


-- 5. delete customer Robert Walter.
